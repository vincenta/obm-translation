Important notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since version 0.5, OBM Translation remember the latest OBM language files directory opened. This information is stored into ~/.obmtranslation. 

Since version 0.4.1, OBM Translation is designed to work by default with current OBM trunk (future OBM 2.2) language files, which are UTF-8 encoded. If you are using OBM Translation with OBM 2.1.X (or under) language files, remember to change the Charset constant in file obmtranslation/config.rb to look like : 

Charset = 'iso-8859-15'

Since version 0.4, you can directly open the file you want to translate with an optional command line argument. As exemple, to edit the calendar.inc file in english, just type the path to this file. 

obmtranslation.rb path/to/obminclude/lang/en/calendar.inc
